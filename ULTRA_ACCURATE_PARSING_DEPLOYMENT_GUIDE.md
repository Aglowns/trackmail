## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### If parsing still shows "Unknown":
1. **Check parsing method** - should show "Real_Email_Patterns"
2. **Verify confidence score** - should be 90%+ for your examples
3. **Check console logs** - should show detailed extraction steps

### If confidence is low:
1. **Check email format** - should match your examples
2. **Verify pattern matching** - should use real email patterns
3. **Review fallback methods** - should use HTML structure analysis

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ‚úÖ **High confidence scores** (90%+ for your examples)
- ‚úÖ **Parsing method** shows "Real_Email_Patterns"
- ‚úÖ **Accurate company names** (Riot Games, Pinterest, Veeva, Zipcar)
- ‚úÖ **Specific job positions** (exact titles from your examples)
- ‚úÖ **Email type classification** (new_application, review_process)

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the updates** to your Apps Script project
2. **Test with your real email examples** to verify accuracy
3. **Check confidence scores** and parsing methods
4. **Verify profession classification** and industry information

## üìà **Analytics and Insights**
