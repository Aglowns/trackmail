# 🧪 Test Your Auth Bridge Deployment

## Quick Test

1. **Copy your Railway domain URL** from the dashboard
   - Example: `https://auth-bridge-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

2. **Open the URL in your browser**
   - You should see the TrackMail sign-in page
   - The page should have:
     - "📧 TrackMail" header
     - "Track your job applications seamlessly" subtitle
     - Email and Password input fields
     - "Sign In" button

3. **Test the Health Endpoint**
   - Add `/health` to your URL
   - Example: `https://your-url.up.railway.app/health`
   - You should see JSON response:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "healthy",
       "active_sessions": 0,
       "supabase_configured": true
     }
     ```

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Railway deployment shows "Active" status
- [ ] Environment variables are set (SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- [ ] Domain is generated and accessible
- [ ] Sign-in page loads in browser
- [ ] Health endpoint returns "healthy" status
- [ ] `supabase_configured: true` in health check

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### Sign-in page doesn't load
- Check Railway logs: Deployments tab → Click on deployment → View logs
- Look for errors in the logs

### Health check shows `supabase_configured: false`
- Environment variables not set correctly
- Go back to Variables tab and verify:
  - `SUPABASE_URL` is set
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set
- Redeploy after fixing

### 502 Bad Gateway or 503 Service Unavailable
- Service is still starting up (wait 1-2 minutes)
- Or there's a build/runtime error (check logs)

### Page loads but can't sign in
- Supabase credentials might be incorrect
- Verify your credentials at: https://app.supabase.com
- Settings → API → Check URL and anon key

## 📝 Save Your Deployment URL

Once everything is working, **save your URL**! You'll need it for:
- Gmail Add-on configuration (next step)
- Testing and development

**My Auth Bridge URL:**
```
_______________________________________________
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

Once your Auth Bridge is deployed and working:

1. ✅ Mark Step 1 as complete in DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
2. ✅ Move to Step 2: Create Gmail Add-on
3. ✅ You'll use this URL in the Gmail Add-on Auth.gs file
