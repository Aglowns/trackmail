# üîç Check Railway Logs to Find the Error

## The Problem
- ‚úÖ Deployment shows "successful" in Railway
- ‚ùå Website still shows "Internal Server Error"
- üîç We need to see the actual error logs

## How to Check Logs

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Click your "trackmail" project**
3. **Click the auth-bridge service**
4. **Click "Deployments" tab**
5. **Click on the "ACTIVE" deployment** (the green one that says "Deployment successful")
6. **Click "View logs" button**
7. **Look for error messages** (usually in red or with "ERROR" in them)

### Method 2: Railway CLI

```powershell
# Make sure you're in auth-bridge directory
cd C:\Users\aglon\Desktop\CURSOR\trackmail\auth-bridge

# View logs
railway logs
```

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Logs (What We Want to See):
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### ‚ùå Bad Logs (Common Errors):

#### 1. Missing Dependencies
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
```
**Solution**: Dependencies not installed

#### 2. Environment Variables Missing
```
SUPABASE_URL not found
KeyError: 'SUPABASE_URL'
```
**Solution**: Environment variables not set

#### 3. Port Issues
```
Permission denied: Port 8001
```
**Solution**: Port configuration issue

#### 4. Python Syntax Error
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
**Solution**: Code has syntax errors

#### 5. Import Errors
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'FastAPI'
```
**Solution**: Dependencies not installed properly

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Check Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to **"Variables"** tab
2. Make sure these are set:
   - `SUPABASE_URL=https://fvpggfqkmldgwjbanwyr.supabase.co`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

### Fix 2: Test Locally First

```powershell
cd C:\Users\aglon\Desktop\CURSOR\trackmail\auth-bridge

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test locally
python main.py
```

If this fails locally, the issue is in the code.

### Fix 3: Simplified main.py for Testing

Let's create a minimal version to test:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    import os
    port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8001))
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

## Most Likely Issues

Based on the "Internal Server Error":

1. **Environment variables not set** (90% likely)
2. **Python import errors** (5% likely)
3. **Port configuration issues** (3% likely)
4. **Other runtime errors** (2% likely)

## Next Steps

1. **Check the logs** using Method 1 or 2 above
2. **Copy the error message** and paste it here
3. **I'll help you fix it** based on the specific error

## Expected Timeline

- **Check logs**: 2 minutes
- **Identify error**: 1 minute
- **Apply fix**: 2 minutes
- **Redeploy**: 3 minutes
- **Test**: 1 minute

**Total**: ~9 minutes to fix
