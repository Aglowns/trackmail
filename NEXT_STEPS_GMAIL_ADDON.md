```
1. User signs up on TrackMail website
2. User goes to Settings → Copies token
3. User opens Gmail → Pastes token in add-on
4. ✅ DONE! Never have to do this again
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If token doesn't work:
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE token (it's very long)
2. Make sure you're signed in with the same Gmail account on both website and Gmail
3. Check that the frontend deployed successfully (Vercel dashboard)
4. Check Gmail add-on logs in Apps Script (View → Logs)

### If refresh token is not showing:
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Hard refresh the Settings page (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Sign out and sign back in
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### If auto-refresh isn't working:
1. Check that `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct in `Auth.gs`
2. Check Gmail add-on logs for refresh errors
3. Try getting a new token from Settings page
